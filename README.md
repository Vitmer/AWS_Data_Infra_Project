# **Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure in AWS**

## **Overview**

This project delivers a **fully automated, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure** in AWS, designed for **enterprise-grade data processing, analytics, and high-availability services**. Built with **Terraform**, the architecture follows **Cloud Engineering best practices**, emphasizing **modularity, automation, and security**.

### **Key Features:**
‚úÖ **Highly Available Network (Multi-AZ VPC with NAT & Internet Gateway).**  
‚úÖ **Data Processing Pipeline (AWS Glue, EMR, Lambda) for ETL automation.**  
‚úÖ **Analytics & Storage (Amazon Redshift, Athena, S3, Glacier).**  
‚úÖ **Enterprise Security Model (IAM, Security Groups, KMS, CloudTrail).**  
‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline (Terraform + GitHub Actions for Infrastructure Automation).**  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, GuardDuty, SIEM Integration).**

## **Architecture Overview**
The cloud infrastructure is built to support large-scale data processing, analytics, and security monitoring. The key components include:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Networking & Security**
- **Multi-AZ VPC:** Ensures high availability across multiple availability zones.
- **NAT Gateway & Internet Gateway:** Secure access for private and public workloads.
- **Security Groups & NACLs:** Restrict unauthorized access based on best practices.
- **IAM Roles & Policies:** Granular access control for different services.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute & Auto-Scaling**
- **Amazon EC2 (Auto-Scaling Groups):** Automatically adjusts compute capacity based on demand.
- **AWS Lambda (Serverless Processing):** Automates data transformation & event-driven workflows.
- **EKS/Kubernetes (Optional):** Supports containerized workloads.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Storage & Data Management**
- **Amazon S3 (Data Lake):** Scalable object storage with lifecycle policies & versioning.
- **Amazon Glacier:** Cost-efficient archival storage.
- **Amazon Redshift:** Cloud-based data warehouse for large-scale analytics.
- **Amazon Athena:** Serverless query service for interactive data analysis.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing & ETL**
- **AWS Glue (ETL Pipelines):** Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Amazon EMR (Apache Spark, Hive, Presto):** High-performance distributed data processing.
- **Event-Driven Processing:** AWS Lambda triggers ETL workflows based on new data events.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Observability & Security**
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Logs, metrics, and alarms for infrastructure monitoring.
- **AWS GuardDuty:** Threat detection and continuous security monitoring.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Audit logging for compliance and forensic analysis.
- **AWS Security Hub:** Centralized security management and automated compliance.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD**
- **Terraform (Infrastructure Automation):** Deploys VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, and monitoring services.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** Automates validation, planning, and deployment of Terraform code.
- **State Management (Terraform Backend - S3 + DynamoDB Locking).**
