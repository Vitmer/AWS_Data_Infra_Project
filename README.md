# **Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure in AWS**

## **Overview**

This project delivers a **fully automated, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure** in AWS, designed for **data processing, analytics, and high-availability services**. Built with **Terraform**, the architecture follows **Cloud Engineering best practices**, emphasizing **automation, security, and scalability**.

### **Key Features:**
‚úÖ **Highly Available Network (Multi-AZ VPC with NAT & Internet Gateway).**  
‚úÖ **Data Processing Pipeline for ETL Automation (S3 + Lambda triggers).**  
‚úÖ **Storage Solutions (Amazon S3 for Data Lake).**  
‚úÖ **Enterprise Security Model (IAM, Security Groups, KMS, CloudTrail).**  
‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline (Terraform + GitHub Actions for Infrastructure Automation).**  
‚úÖ **Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch, GuardDuty, CloudTrail).**

## **Architecture Overview**
The cloud infrastructure is designed to support scalable and secure data processing and analytics. The key components include:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Networking & Security**
- **Multi-AZ VPC:** Ensures high availability across multiple availability zones.
- **Internet Gateway:** Provides secure public access to resources as needed.
- **Security Groups:** Restrict unauthorized access to resources.
- **IAM Roles & Policies:** Granular access control for services and users.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Compute & Auto-Scaling**
- **Amazon EC2 (Auto-Scaling Groups):** Automatically adjusts compute capacity based on demand.
- **AWS Lambda (Serverless Processing):** Automates event-driven workflows.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Storage & Data Management**
- **Amazon S3 (Data Lake):** Scalable object storage with lifecycle policies and versioning.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Observability & Security**
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Logs, metrics, and alarms for infrastructure monitoring.
- **AWS GuardDuty:** Threat detection and continuous security monitoring.
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Audit logging for compliance and forensic analysis.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD**
- **Terraform (Infrastructure Automation):** Deploys VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, and monitoring services.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** Automates validation, planning, and deployment of Terraform code.
- **State Management (Terraform Backend - S3 + DynamoDB Locking).**

## **Deployment Instructions**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Terraform v1.3+**
- **AWS CLI configured with an IAM role**
- **GitHub Actions enabled for CI/CD automation**

### **Steps**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Vitmer/AWS_Data_Infra_Project.git
   cd AWS_Data_Infra_Project
   ```
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```
3. **Preview changes:**
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```
4. **Deploy infrastructure:**
   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```

## **Monitoring & Security Best Practices**
- **Enable CloudTrail & log storage in S3 with lifecycle policies.**
- **Use IAM Role-based Access Control (RBAC).**
- **Encrypt data using AWS KMS where applicable.**
- **Regularly audit IAM permissions & security configurations.**
